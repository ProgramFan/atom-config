  abstract = {This volume presents fourteen new essays by leading figures in the fields of ancient philosophy and contemporary metaphysics, discussing Aristotle's theory of the unity of substances. This topic remains at the centre of metaphysical enquiry. The contributors examine the nature of essences, how they differ from other components of substance, and how they are related to these other components. The central questions discussed here are: What does Aristotle mean by 'potentiality' and 'actuality'? How do these concepts explicate matter and form, and how are they related to the actuality of substance? What is the role of matter and form in accounting for the unity, identity, and individuation of substances? These questions are crucial to an understanding of the unity of composite substances and their identity over time. The aim of the volume is both exegetical and philosophical: to address central issues in Aristotle's Metaphysics, and to stimulate further investigation of the problems and controversies that arise from these.},

  abstract = {It is standard practice to introduce the entries in a work ofreference with a definition of the topic. However, the concept ofobject—that concept of object which is of fundamentalinterest within philosophy—is among the most general concepts (orcategories) which we possess. It seems very doubtful that it can bedefined in more general terms; the best that seems possible is to tracerelationships with other highly general concepts. Ernst Tugendhat(1982, 21–23) compares what he calls “a concept of modernphilosophy, that of an object”, with the Aristotelian concept ofbeing (which is, as he puts it, a “term of art”).Tugendhat then proceeds to ask:, In this entry, some of the various conceptions of object aredocumented and explored; and as with Tugendhat, their roles in logic,ontology and the philosophy of language are examined. While the focusis chiefly on contemporary philosophical writings, the philosophies ofthe past (and their continued influence) have an important role toplay. Relationships between the very highest-level concepts of logicand semantics, and the more concrete applications of these concepts inmetaphysics and ontology, are among the topics for review. Tugendhattells us that “The fundamental question of ontology is: what isbeing as being?”, and he reformulates this question as thequestion of “what it means to speak of an object”. Recentwork suggests that Tugendhat's reformulation of the‘question of ontology’ may be, at any rate,contestable.},

This volume collects classic and original contributions from leading experts in both fields for a provocative discussion of the issues. It contains accessible introductions to the main and less-well-known known approaches to quantum gravity. It includes exciting topics such as the fate of spacetime in various theories, the so-called "problem of time" in canonical quantum gravity, black hole thermodynamics, and the relationship between the interpretation of quantum theory and quantum gravity. This book will be essential reading for anyone interested in the profound implications of trying to marry the two most important theories in physics.},

  abstract = {In the 1830s, W. R. Hamilton established a formal analogy between optics and mechanics by constructing a mathematical equivalence between the extremum principles of ray optics (Fermat's principle) and corpuscular mechanics (Maupertuis's principle). Almost a century later, this optical-mechanical analogy played a central role in the development of wave mechanics. Schrödinger was well acquainted with Hamilton's analogy through earlier studies. From Schrödinger's research notebooks, we show how he used the analogy as a heuristic tool to develop de Broglie's ideas about matter waves and how the role of the analogy in his thinking changed from a heuristic tool into a formal constraint on possible wave equations. We argue that Schrödinger only understood the full impact of the optical-mechanical analogy during the preparation of his second communication on wave mechanics: Classical mechanics is an approximation to the new undulatory mechanics, just as ray optics is an approximation to wave optics. This completion of the analogy convinced Schrödinger to stick to a realist interpretation of the wave function, in opposition to the emerging mainstream. The transformations in Schrödinger's use of the optical-mechanical analogy can be traced in his research notebooks, which offer a much more complete picture of the development of wave mechanics than has been previously thought possible.},

Post’s thesis (what he calls the “generalized principle of correspondence”) is both historical and methodological; it may be simply put as the claim that what is taken over from preceding theories is not only those laws and experimental facts which are well-confirmed, but also ‘patterns’ and ‘internal connections’, that in this way the successor theory accounts for whatever success its precursor enjoyed, for it “… will in fact embody a good deal of the (lower) theoretical structure of the [precursor] theory.” (1971, p. 229).},

  abstract = {A structuralist perspective is one that sees the investigation of the structural features of a domain of interest as the primary goal of enquiry. This vision has shaped research programmes in fields as diverse as linguistics, literary criticism, aesthetics, sociology, anthropology, psychology, and various branches of philosophy. The focus of this paper is structuralism in the philosophy of science, and in particular those movements that have endeavoured to articulate a structural version of scientific realism, now commonly referred to as structural realism (SR). The paper provides a critical survey of the debates raging over structural realism: it provides explicit statements of the different positions as well as the arguments put forward to support them, clarifies how the different positions relate to one another, draws attention to hitherto neglected arguments, and evaluates criticisms launched against different strands of SR. Attention to the history of the field is paid in as far as this is essential to understanding the contemporary scene, but documenting the long and intricate development of SR is beyond the scope of this paper. We begin by introducing the set theoretic conception of structure on which many of the positions that we are concerned with rely (Section 2). In Section 3 we introduce the two main strands of epistemic structural realism, discuss the central objections levelled against them, most notably Newman’s objection, and present the Ramsey sentence formulation. Section 4 is dedicated to a discussion of ontic structural realism. In Section 5 we offer some concluding remarks.},

In the attempt to reconcile quantum mechanics with relativity theory, that is, one is driven to a field theory; all talk about “particles” has to be understood, at least in principle, as talk about the properties of, and interactions among, quantized fields. I want to suggest, today, that it is possible to capture this thesis in a convincing “no-go theorem”. Indeed, it seems to me that various technical results on the “non-localizability” of particles in (so-called) relativistic quantum mechanics, going back some thirty years, are best understood as versions of such a theorem.1},

This view stands in between scientific realism and agnostic instrumentalism and intends to accommodate both the intuitions that underwrite the ‘no miracles’ argument for scientific realism and the existence of scientific revolutions which lead to radical theoretical changes. Structural realism presents itself as the best of both worlds. In this paper I critically examine the epistemic status of structural realism, and argue that it is not the best of both worlds. Yet, I stress that it reveals an insight which, properly understood, can cast new light on the debates over scientific realism.},

Two versions of Newton–Cartan gravity can be identified in the physics literature—a “weak” version and a “strong” version. The strong version has a constrained Hamiltonian formulation and consequently a well-defined gauge structure, whereas the weak version does not (with some qualifications). Moreover, the strong version is best compared with the structure of what Earman (World enough and spacetime. Cambridge: MIT Press) has dubbed Maxwellian spacetime. This suggests that there are also two versions of Newtonian gravity in flat spacetime—a “weak” version in Maxwellian spacetime, and a “strong” version in Neo-Newtonian spacetime. I conclude by indicating how these alternative formulations of Newtonian gravity impact the notion of empirical indistinguishability and the debate over scientific realism.},

It separates the issues and provides newperspectives on absolute relational accounts of motion and relational-substantival accounts of theontology of space time.Earman's sustained treatment and imaginative insights raise to a new levelthe debate on these important issues at the boundary of philosophy and physics. He surveys thehistory of the controversy from Newton to Einstein develops the mathematics and physics needed topose the issues in sharp form and provides a persuasive assessment of the philosophical problemsinvolved.Most importantly, Earman revitalizes the connection of the debate to contemporary science.He shows, for example, how concerns raised by Leibniz form the core of ongoing debate on thefoundations of general theory of relativity, moving the discussion into a new and vital arena andintroducing arguments that will be discussed for years to come.John Earman is Professor of Historyand Philosophy of Science at the University of Pittsburgh.

The central questions discussed here are: What does Aristotle mean by 'potentiality' and 'actuality'? How do these concepts explicate matter and form, and how are they related to the actuality of substance? What is the role of matter and form in accounting for the unity, identity, and individuation of substances? These questions are crucial to an understanding of the unity of composite substances and their identity over time. The aim of the volume is both exegetical and philosophical: to address central issues in Aristotle's Metaphysics, and to stimulate further investigation of the problems and controversies that arise from these.},

Silk describes how physicists apply theories of subatomic particles to recreate the first moments of the Big Bang, and how astronomers chart the vast depths of space to glimpse how the most distant galaxies formed. He gives an account of the search for dark matter and the dark energy that will determine the ultimate fate of the Universe.

  abstract = {Handbook of Analysis and Its Foundations is a self-contained and unified handbook on mathematical analysis and its foundations. Intended as a self-study guide for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduatestudents in mathematics and a reference for more advanced mathematicians, this highly readable book provides broader coverage than competing texts in the area. Handbook of Analysis and Its Foundations provides an introduction to a wide range of topics, including: algebra; topology; normed spaces; integration theory; topological vector spaces; and differential equations. The author effectively demonstrates the relationships between these topics and includes a few chapters on set theory and logic to explain the lack of examples for classical pathological objects whose existence proofs are not constructive. More complete than any other book on the subject, students will find this to be an invaluable handbook. For more information on this book, see http://math.vanderbilt.edu/Key Features* Covers some hard-to-find results including:* Bessagas and Meyers converses of the Contraction Fixed Point Theorem* Redefinition of subnets by Aarnes and Andenaes* Ghermans characterization of topological convergences* Neumanns nonlinear Closed Graph Theorem* van Maarens geometry-free version of Sperners Lemma* Includes a few advanced topics in functional analysis* Features all areas of the foundations of analysis except geometryCombines material usually found in many different sources, making this unified treatment more convenient for the user* Has its own webpage: http://math.vanderbilt.edu/},

  abstract = {Universally recognized as bringing about a revolutionary transformation of the notions of space, time, and motion in physics, Einstein's theory of gravitation, known as "general relativity," was also a defining event for 20th century philosophy of science. During the decisive first ten years of the theory's existence, two main tendencies dominated its philosophical reception. This book is an extended argument that the path actually taken, which became logical empiricist philosophy of science, greatly contributed to the current impasse over realism, whereas new possibilities are opened in revisiting and reviving the spirit of the more sophisticated tendency, a cluster of viewpoints broadly termed transcendental idealism, and furthering its articulation. It also emerges that Einstein, while paying lip service to the emerging philosophy of logical empiricism, ended up siding de facto with the latter tendency.    Ryckman's work speaks to several groups, among them philosophers of science and historians of relativity. Equations are displayed as necessary, but Ryckman gives the non-mathematical reader enough background to understand their occurrence in the context of his wider philosophical project.},

Incidentally, in the last couple of years interest from the philosophy of physics in structural realism—in the eyes of its proponents the best suited realist position towards modern physics—has also raised. This paper tries to connect both topics and aims to show that structural realism gains further credence from an ontological analysis of gauge theories—in particular U ( 1 ) gauge theory. In the first part of the paper the framework of fiber bundle gauge theories is briefly presented and the interpretation of local gauge symmetry will be examined. In the second part, an ontological underdetermination of gauge theories is carved out by considering the various kinds of non-locality involved in such typical effects as the Aharonov–Bohm effect. The analysis shows that the peculiar form of non-separability figuring in gauge theories is a variant of spatiotemporal holism and can be distinguished from quantum theoretic holism. In the last part of the paper the arguments for a gauge theoretic support of structural realism are laid out and discussed.},

The central questions discussed here are: What does Aristotle mean by 'potentiality' and 'actuality'? How do these concepts explicate matter and form, and how are they related to the actuality of substance? What is the role of matter and form in accounting for the unity, identity, and individuation of substances? These questions are crucial to an understanding of the unity of composite substances and their identity over time. The aim of the volume is both exegetical and philosophical: to address central issues in Aristotle's Metaphysics, and to stimulate further investigation of the problems and controversies that arise from these.},

In his search for a theory of gravity, he noted that if the equations of motion are covariant under arbitrary coordinate transformations, then particle coordinates at a given time can be varied arbitrarily — they are underdetermined — even if their values at all earlier times are held fixed. It is the same for the values of fields. The argument can also be made out in terms of transformations acting on the points of the manifold, rather than on the coordinates assigned to the points. So the equations of motion do not fix the particle positions, or the values of fields at manifold points, or particle coordinates, or fields as functions of the coordinates, even when they are specified at all earlier times. It is surely the business of physics to predict these sorts of quantities, given their values at earlier times. The principle of general covariance seemed quite untenable.},

This isthe doctrine that exactly one concrete object token exists. Prioritymonism also targets concrete objects but counts by basic tokens. Thisis the doctrine that exactly one concrete object token is basic, andequivalent to the classical doctrine that the whole is prior to its(proper) parts., Neither existence nor priority monism is accorded much respect incontemporary metaphysics, nor are they always properly distinguished.Indeed, the tradition associated with these doctrines has long beendismissed as being somewhere between obscure and ridiculous. But thereare serious arguments for monism. Priority monism may especiallydeserve serious reconsideration, of a kind that it is only nowbeginning to receive., Though I will focus on existence monism and priority monism, thereare of course other historically important monisms, includingsubstance monism. Substance monism targets concrete objectsand counts by highest types. This is the doctrine that all concreteobjects fall under one highest type (perhaps material, or mental, orsome neutral underlying type: here the way divides).

And how do they relate to other metaphysical notions, such as modality, truth-making or essence? This volume of new essays, by leading figures in contemporary metaphysics, is the first to address and investigate the metaphysical idea that certain facts are grounded in other facts.

  title = {Forces and {{Fields}}},
  abstract = {Forces and Fields by Mary Hesse is a history of physics surrounding the question: “How do bodies act on one another across space?” Hesse illustrates this through various answers, discussing period of transition in fundamental physics in which new concepts and ideas have been introduced and made scientifically testable, and makes a certain philosophical interpretation of science from the beginning. Some topics include the logical status of theories, primitive analogies, mechanism in Greek science, the Greek inheritance, Corpuscular Philosophy, The Theory of Gravitation and The Theory of Relativity, as well as others. Mary B. Hesse (born 1924) was a contemporary English philosopher of science. She is now professor emerita of the philosophy of science at Cambridge University. Her publication Models and Analogies in Science is a widely cited and accessible introduction to the topic. Hesse argues, contra Duhem, that models and analogies are integral to understanding scientific practice in general and scientific advancement in particular, especially how the domain of a scientific theory is extended and how theories generate genuinely novel predictions. Examples of such models include the famous billiard ball model of the dynamical theory of gases and models of light based on analogies to sound and water waves. Hesse thinks that, in order help us understand a new system or phenomenon, we will often create an analogical model that compares this new system or phenomenon with a more familiar system or phenomenon. In her book, Hesse makes a distinction between three types of analogues in scientific models: positive analogies, negative analogies, and neutral analogies. Positive analogies are those features which are known or thought to be shared by both systems, negative analogies are those features which are known or thought to be present in one system but absent in the other, and neutral analogies are those features whose status as positive or negative analogies is uncertain at present. Neutral analogies are by far the most interesting of the three types of analogies, for they suggest ways to test the limits of our models, guiding the way for scientific advancement. In the late 19th century, for example, the idea that light-waves have a physical medium called the luminiferous ether would have been best thought of as a neutral analogy with water and sound waves. Eventually, due to a null result in the Michelson-Morley and Trouton-Noble experiments, as well as other similar experiments, this analogy came to be accepted as a negative analogy - we now accept that light has no physical medium, unlike sound and water waves. The discovery of this negative analogy led to further advancement, including the unification of electro-magnetic theory with optics, and the eventual creation of new and more informative models of light.},

This topic remains at the centre of metaphysical enquiry. The contributors examine the nature of essences, how they differ from other components of substance, and how they are related to these other components. The central questions discussed here are: What does Aristotle mean by 'potentiality' and 'actuality'? How do these concepts explicate matter and form, and how are they related to the actuality of substance? What is the role of matter and form in accounting for the unity, identity, and individuation of substances? These questions are crucial to an understanding of the unity of composite substances and their identity over time. The aim of the volume is both exegetical and philosophical: to address central issues in Aristotle's Metaphysics, and to stimulate further investigation of the problems and controversies that arise from these.},

He defends a form of essentialism that he calls individuative essentialism, and then a form of realism that he calls conceptualist realism. In a final chapter he advocates a human being-based conception of the identity and individuation of persons, arguing that any satisfactory account of personal memory must make reference to the life of the rememberer himself. This important book will appeal to a wide range of readers in metaphysics, philosophical logic, and analytic philosophy.},

By contrast to a radical metaphysics of relations, the position set out in this paper recognizes things that stand in the relations, but claims that, as far as the relations are concerned, there is no need for these things to have qualitative intrinsic properties underlying the relations. This position thus opposes a metaphysics of individual things that are characterized by intrinsic properties. A principal problem of the latter position is that it seems that we cannot gain any knowledge of these properties insofar as they are intrinsic. Against this background, the rationale behind a metaphysics of relations is to avoid a gap between epistemology and metaphysics.},

These sorts of ordinary objects may seem utterly unproblematicin comparison to entities like numbers, propositions, tropes, holes,points of space, and moments of time. Yet, on closer inspection, theyare at least as puzzling, if not more so. Reflection onMichelangelo's David and the piece of marble of which itis made threatens to lead to the surprising conclusion that these wouldhave to be two different objects occupying the same location andsharing all of their parts. Reflection on the availability ofmicrophysical explanations for events that we take to be caused byordinary objects threatens to lead to the conclusion that ordinaryobjects—if they do exist—never themselves cause anything tohappen. And reflection on the possibility of alternative conceptualschemes, which “carve up the world” in radically differentways, makes our own conception of which objects there are seemintolerably arbitrary. Taken together, the various puzzles that arisein connection with ordinary objects make a powerful case for theirelimination. And, in many cases, what seem to be the bestresponses to these puzzles require the postulation of legions ofobjects that we fail to notice despite their being right before oureyes., In §1, I articulate a variety of ways of departing from ourordinary conception of objects, either by eliminating ordinary objectsor by permitting more objects than we would ordinarily take to exist.In §§2–6, I examine the puzzles and arguments that are meantto motivate these departures. In §7, I examine some arguments indefense of the ordinary conception.},

  shorttitle = {The {{Disorder}} of {{Things}}},
  abstract = {The great dream of philosophers and scientists for millennia has been to give us a complete account of the order of things. A powerful articulation of such a dream in this century has been found in the idea of a unity of science. With this manifesto, John Dupre systematically attacks the ideal of scientific unity by showing how its underlying assumptions are at odds with the central conclusions of science itself. In its stead, the author gives us a metaphysics much more in keeping with what science tells us about the world. The order presupposed by scientific unity is expressed in the classical philosophical doctrines of essentialism, materialist reductionism, and determinism. Employing examples from biology, that most "disordered" of sciences, Dupre subjects each of these doctrines to detailed and devastating criticism. He also identifies the shortcomings of contemporary approaches to scientific disunity, such as constructivism and extreme empiricism. He argues that we should adopt a "moderate realism" consistent with pluralistic science. Dupre's proposal for a "promiscuous realism" acknowledges the existence of a fundamentally disordered world, in which different projects or perspectives may reveal distinct, somewhat isolated, but nevertheless perfectly real domains of partial order. This argument makes connections with recent discussions of science and value, especially in the work of feminist scholars. In Dupre's view, we have a great deal of choice about which scientific projects to pursue, a choice that can be informed only by value judgments. Such choices determine not only what kinds of order we observe in nature but also what kinds of order we impose on the world we observe.Elegantly written and compellingly argued, this provocative book should be of crucial interest to all philosophers and scholars of science.},

  abstract = {Scientific realism says of our best scientific theories that (1) most of their important posits exist and (2) most of their central claims are approximately true. Antirealists sometimes offer the pessimistic induction in reply: since (1) and (2) are false about past successful theories, they are probably false about our own best theories too. The contemporary debate about this argument has turned (and become stuck) on the question, Do the central terms of successful scientific theories refer? For example, Larry Laudan offers a list of successful theories that employed central terms that failed to refer, and Philip Kitcher replies with a view about reference in which the central terms of such theories did sometimes refer. This article attempts to break this stalemate by proposing a direct version of the pessimistic induction, one that makes no explicit appeal to a substantive notion or theory of reference. While it is premature to say that this argument succeeds in showing that realism is probably false, the direct pessimistic induction is not subject to any kind of reference-based objection that might cripple a weaker, indirect version of the argument. Any attempt to trounce the direct pessimistic induction with a theory of reference fails.},

  url = {http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/atomism-modern/},
  abstract = {Atomism in the form in which it first emerged in Ancient Greece was ametaphysical thesis, purporting to establish claims about the ultimatenature of material reality by philosophical argument. Versions ofatomism developed by mechanical philosophers in the seventeenthcentury shared that characteristic. By contrast, the knowledge ofatoms that is now taken for granted in modern science is notestablished by a priori philosophical argument but by appealto quite specific experimental results interpreted and guided by aquite specific theory, quantum mechanics. If metaphysics involves anattempt to give an account of the basic nature of material realitythen it is an issue about which science rather than philosophy hasmost to say. A study of the path from philosophical atomism tocontemporary scientific atomism helps to shed light on the nature ofphilosophy and science and the relationship between the two., From the nineteenth century onwards, when serious versions ofscientific atomism first emerged, the philosophical relevance of ahistory of atomism becomes epistemological rather than metaphysical.Since atoms lie far beyond the domain of observation, shouldhypotheses concerning them form part of empirical science? There werecertainly philosophers and scientists of the nineteenth century whoanswered that question in the negative. Contemporary philosophersdiffer over the question of whether the debate was essentially ascientific one or a philosophical one. Was there a case to opposeatomism on the grounds that it was unfruitful or lacking in adequateexperimental support, or did such a case stem from some generalepistemological thesis, perhaps some brand of positivism, that ruledout of court any attempt to explain observable phenomena by invokingunobservable atoms? Many contemporary philosophers see the ultimatetriumph of atomism as a victory for realism over positivism. Suchclaims are historical as well as philosophical, so it is important toget the history straight when evaluating them. In this respect thephilosophical literature has yet to catch up with recent advances inthe history of nineteenth-century chemistry. This entry gives anaccount of the key developments in atomism from the seventeenthcentury until the time, early in the twentieth century, when theexistence of atoms ceased to be a contentious issue. The focus is onthe epistemological status of the various versions, and on therelationship between science and philosophy.},

  abstract = {What is consciousness? How do physical processes in the brain give rise to the self-aware mind and to feelings as profoundly varied as love or hate, aesthetic pleasure or spiritual yearning? These questions today are among the most hotly debated issues among scientists and philosophers, and we have seen in recent years superb volumes by such eminent figures as Francis Crick, Daniel C. Dennett, Gerald Edelman, and Roger Penrose, all firing volleys in what has come to be called the consciousness wars. Now, in The Conscious Mind, philosopher David J. Chalmers offers a cogent analysis of this heated debate as he unveils a major new theory of consciousness, one that rejects the prevailing reductionist trend of science, while offering provocative insights into the relationship between mind and brain. Writing in a rigorous, thought-provoking style, the author takes us on a far-reaching tour through the philosophical ramifications of consciousness. Chalmers convincingly reveals how contemporary cognitive science and neurobiology have failed to explain how and why mental events emerge from physiological occurrences in the brain. He proposes instead that conscious experience must be understood in an entirely new light--as an irreducible entity (similar to such physical properties as time, mass, and space) that exists at a fundamental level and cannot be understood as the sum of its parts. And after suggesting some intriguing possibilities about the structure and laws of conscious experience, he details how his unique reinterpretation of the mind could be the focus of a new science. Throughout the book, Chalmers provides fascinating thought experiments that trenchantly illustrate his ideas. For example, in exploring the notion that consciousness could be experienced by machines as well as humans, Chalmers asks us to imagine a thinking brain in which neurons are slowly replaced by silicon chips that precisely duplicate their functions--as the neurons are replaced, will consciousness gradually fade away? The book also features thoughtful discussions of how the author's theories might be practically applied to subjects as diverse as artificial intelligence and the interpretation of quantum mechanics. All of us have pondered the nature and meaning of consciousness. Engaging and penetrating, The Conscious Mind adds a fresh new perspective to the subject that is sure to spark debate about our understanding of the mind for years to come.},

In the case of the emergence of special relativity, one of the four scientific revolutions Post discussed in defending his rationale of ‘conservative induction’, the observation is particularly apt. In the present paper, I want first to elaborate on this theme. Einstein’s 1905 postulates have larger “footprints” — to borrow Post’s term — in the “old theory” (if by this is meant the assortment of Maxwell-Lorentz ether electrodynamics, classical mechanics and thermodynamics) than is perhaps still widely appreciated.},

  url = {http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/sortals/},
  abstract = {Many philosophers believe that the category of sortals is aphilosophically important one, or at least they believe that mostphilosophers believe that. However, the concept is less clear and morecriticized than is generally recognized. There is variation, inwhether ‘sortal’ is applied to linguistic items, e.g.,predicates or words, abstract entities, e.g., universals orproperties, or psychological entities, e.g., concepts.  There is alsovariation, mostly unnoticed, in how ‘sortal’ isdefined. Much of the disagreement is probably masked by the fact thatthere is agreement on some examples, so ‘tiger’ (or theassociated concept or universal) is a sortal and ‘water’is not. , In the least interesting (and uncontroversial) sense, an expression isa sortal if and only if it takes numerical modifiers.  Thus ‘icecube’ is a sortal because the adjectives associated with it arenumerical—we say "two ice cubes", but ‘water’ is nota sortal since the usual modifiers are mass terms, i.e., we ask for"two cups of water". Or in slightly different terms, we ask "How manyice cubes do you want?" but "How much water do you want?" Of course wecan often make sense of ‘how many’ questions aboutnon-sortals if a suitable measure is understood. Thus "How manycoffees would you like?" is really understood as "How many cups…?" Many words have two distinct though related meanings, oneof which is sortal and one of which is not. For example, we can askboth "How many chickens do you want?"  and "How much chicken do youwant?"  This linguistic distinction is often called the "countnoun/mass noun" distinction by both philosophers andlinguists. Although in many cases the distinction matches with morephilosophical distinctions about the kind of item the noun refers to,the distinction is a linguistic one. For example,‘furniture’ is a mass noun even though all of the thingsit is true of are also referred to by count nouns such as‘table’ or ‘chair’. And words vary acrosslanguages; ‘spaghetti’ is a mass noun in English, but isthe plural of the count noun ‘spaghetto’ in Italian. , In a more significant sense, the sortal/nonsortal distinction iswidely believed by philosophers to mark a metaphysically importantdifference. However, the distinction is characterized in at least sixdifferent ways.  A sortal: , The first two are closely connected, since counting objects involvesquestions about which objects are and are not identical. The last isconnected to the first two since if proper parts of an object of thatkind are themselves of that kind, then it is not clear that one cancount things of that kind.  The other three are closely connectedsince specifying the essence of a thing is a good way of answering thequestion "What is it?", and if a characteristic is part of the essencethen an object cannot lack that without ceasing to exist. The thirdprovides a connection between the first two and 3-5, since whethersomething exists at a time is often relevant for counting either at atime or across times., It is easy to see that the first pair apply more broadly than the nextthree.  ‘Kitten’ provides criteria of identity andcounting, but does not specify an essence, is not required forcontinued existence (i.e., a kitten does not cease to exist when itreaches maturity) and does not answer the "What is it?"  question inthe way philosophers have in mind.. The standard terminology forconcepts like ‘kitten’ which apply during a certain phaseof an object's existence is "phase sortal" (Wiggins 1967) whileexpressions such as "red table" are usually said to be‘restricted sortals’. The remaining sortals are sometimescalled ‘substance sortals’ (Wiggins 1967) "pure sortals"(Hale and Wright 2001, 386ff) or sometimes simply and confusingly‘sortals’. , The concepts of a ‘sortal’ are closely connected withissues about identity, persistence and change. For example, debatecontinues over Locke's claim that two things of the same sort cannotoccupy exactly the same spatial region. An apparent counterexample isthat of a statue and the material which composes it. One defense ofLocke's principle against this alleged counterexample is that theseare not the same sort of thing so it does not violate the principle;another is to identify the statue and material, sustaining theprinciple by a different route. Both of these lines have beendeveloped, and criticized. This article reviews the history of theconcept(s) of a sortal and how they came to be thought important inthe mid 20th century, analyzes the six differing ways of defining"sortal", reviews ‘logics of sortals’ and concludes byattempting to summarize and evaluate the importance of thedistinction(s).},

The general idea is that the nature of the actual world(i.e. the universe and everything in it) conforms to a certaincondition, the condition of being physical. Of course, physicalistsdon't deny that the world might contain many items that at firstglance don't seem physical — items of a biological, orpsychological, or moral, or social nature.

  volume = {5},
  abstract = {Genetic engineering in agriculture raises contentious politics unknown in other applications of molecular technology. Controversy originated and persists for inter-related reasons; these are not primarily, as frequently assumed, differences over scientific findings, but rather about the relationship of science to ‘risk.’ First, there are inevitably differences in how to interpret ‘risk’ in situations in which there are no established findings of specific hazard; ‘Knightian uncertainty’ defines this condition. Science claims no method of resolution in such cases of uncertainty. Second, science has no claim about risk preferences in a normative sense. In genetic engineering, Knightian uncertainty is pervasive; declaring uncertainty to constitute ‘risk’ enables a precautionary politics in which no conceivable evidence from science can confirm absence of risk. This is the logic of the precautionary state. The logic of the developmental state is quite different: uncertainty is treated as an inevitable component of change, and therefore a logic of acceptable uncertainty, parallel to acceptable risk of the sort deployed in cost-benefit analysis in other spheres of behavior, dominates policy. India's official position on agricultural biotechnology has been promotional, as expected from a developmental state, but regulation of Bt crops has rested in a section of the state operating more on precautionary than developmental logic. As a result, notwithstanding the developmental success of Bt cotton, Bt brinjal [eggplant, aubergine] encountered a moratorium on deployment despite approval by the regulatory scientific body designated to assess biosafety.},

This article surveys several prominent versions of such theories advocated by philosophers, and the many difficulties they face. Philosophical statements of the manipulationist approach are generally reductionist in aspiration and assign a central role to human action. These contrast with recent discussions employing a broadly manipulationist framework for understanding causation, such as those due to the computer scientist Judea Pearl and others, which are non-reductionist and rely instead on the notion of an intervention. This is simply an appropriately exogenous causal process; it has no essential connection with human action. This interventionist framework manages to avoid at least some of these difficulties faced by traditional philosophical versions of the manipulability theory and helps to clarify the content of causal claims.},

  abstract = {Modern Cosmology begins with an introduction to the smooth, homogeneous universe described by a Friedman-Robertson-Walker metric, including careful treatments of dark energy, big bang nucleosynthesis, recombination, and dark matter. From this starting point, the reader is introduced to perturbations about an FRW universe: their evolution with the Einstein-Boltzmann equations, their generation by primordial inflation, and their observational consequences. These consequences include the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) featuring acoustic peaks and polarization, the matter power spectrum with baryonic wiggles, and their detection via photometric galaxy surveys, redshift distortions, cluster abundances, and weak lensing. The book concludes with a long chapter on data analysis. Modern Cosmology is the first book to explain in detail the structure of the acoustic peaks in the CMB, the E/B decomposition in polarization which may allow for detection of primordial gravity waves, and the modern analysis techniques used on increasingly large cosmological data sets. Readers will gain the tools needed to work in cosmology and learn how modern observations are rapidly revolutionizing our picture of the universe. * Provides foundations, calculations, and interpretations which illuminate current thinking in cosmology * Covers the major advances in cosmology over the past decade* Includes over 100 unique, pedagogical figures},

It then considers, basic limits on observations; the need to test alternatives; ways to test consistency; and implications of the uniqueness of the universe as regards distinguishing laws of physics from contingent conditions. It goes on to look at the idea of a multiverse as a scientific explanation of facts about fine-tuning, in particular considering criteria for a scientific theory and for justifying unseen entities. It considers the relation between physical laws and the natures of existence, and emphasizes limits on our knowledge of the physics relevant to the early universe (the physics horizon), and the non-physical nature of some claimed infinities. The final section looks briefly at deeper issues, commenting on the scope of enquiry of cosmological theory and the limits of science in relation to the creation of the universe.},

In tracking the history of energy, this book is filled with the thrill of the chase, the mystery of smoke and mirrors, and presents a fascinating human-interest story. Moreover, following the history provides a crucial aid to understanding: this book explains the intellectual revolutions required to comprehend energy, revolutions as profound as those stemming from Relativity and Quantum Theory. Texts by Descartes, Leibniz, Bernoulli, d'Alembert, Lagrange, Hamilton, Boltzmann, Clausius, Carnot and others are made accessible, and the engines of Watt and Joule are explained. Many fascinating questions are covered, including: - Why just kinetic and potential energies - is one more fundamental than the other? - What are heat, temperature and action? - What is the Hamiltonian? - What have engines to do with physics? - Why did the steam-engine evolve only in England? - Why S=klogW works and why temperature is IT. Using only a minimum of mathematics, this book explains the emergence of the modern concept of energy, in all its forms: Hamilton's mechanics and how it shaped twentieth-century physics, and the meaning of kinetic energy, potential energy, temperature, action, and entropy. It is as much an explanation of fundamental physics as a history of the fascinating discoveries that lie behind our knowledge today.},

Against positivism, the author insists on a literal interpretation of the language of science, and on an irreducibly pragmatic dimension of theory acceptance. Against realism he argues that the central aim of science is empirical adequacy, and that the only belief involved in the acceptance of a scientific theory is belief that the theory fits the observable phenomena. To substatiate this, the book presents three mutually supporting theories concerning science. The first is an account of the relation between a scientific theory and the empirical world. The second is a new theory of explanation and why-questions, according to which the explanatory power of a theory is a pragmatic aspect which goes beyond its empirical import, but which provides no additional reasons for believing it. And the third is an interpretation of probability in physical theory, with reference to both classical and quantum physics. The presentation of these three central theses is preceded by two chapters which provide an informal introduction to current debates in the philosophy of science, particularly concerning scientific realism.},

I argue against both views. Virtually all plausible ontologies turn out to be committed to the existence of free masses. I develop and defend the view that the clustering of properties is a mere contingent truth, on grounds that properties can be substracted one-by-one.

  abstract = {The big news about chaos is supposed to be that the smallest ofchanges in a system can result in very large differences in thatsystem’s behavior. The so-called butterfly effect has become one ofthe most popular images of chaos. The idea is that the flapping of abutterfly’s wings in Argentina could cause a tornado in Texas threeweeks later. By contrast, in an identical copy of the world sans theArgentinian butterfly, no such storm would have arisen in Texas. Themathematical version of this property is known as sensitivedependence. However, it turns out that sensitive dependence issomewhat old news, so some of the implications flowing from it areperhaps not such “big news” after all. Still, chaosstudies have highlighted these implications in fresh ways and led tothinking about other implications as well.,  In addition to exhibiting sensitive dependence, chaotic systemspossess two other properties: they are deterministic and nonlinear(Smith 2007). This entry discusses systems exhibiting these threeproperties and what their philosophical implications might be fortheories and theoretical understanding, confirmation, explanation,realism, determinism, free will and consciousness, and human anddivine action.},

  abstract = {In the mid to late 1890s, J. J. Thomson and colleagues at Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory conducted experiments on "cathode rays" (a form of radiation produced within evacuated glass vessels subjected to electric fields) -- the results of which some historians later viewed as the "discovery" of the electron. This book is both a biography of the electron and a history of the microphysical world that it opened up.The book is organized in four parts. The first part, Corpuscles and Electrons, considers the varying accounts of Thomson's role in the experimental production of the electron. The second part, What Was the Newborn Electron Good For?, examines how scientists used the new entity in physical and chemical investigations. The third part, Electrons Applied and Appropriated, explores the accommodation, or lack thereof, of the electron in nuclear physics, chemistry, and electrical science. It follows the electron's gradual progress from cathode ray to ubiquitous subatomic particle and eponymous entity in one of the world's most successful industries -- electronics. The fourth part, Philosophical Electrons, considers the role of the electron in issues of instrumentalism, epistemology, and realism. The electron, it turns out, can tell us a great deal about how science works.},

Subsequently he discusses Aristotle's metaphysics, the theory of categories, logical theory, and his conception of the human being as a composite of soul and body.The last part concentrates on Aristotle's value theory as applied to ethics and politics, and assesses his approach to happiness, virtue, and the best life for human beings, before turning to a consideration of Aristotle's theory of rhetoric and the arts, with a special focus on his perennially controversial treatment of tragedy.This second edition includes an expanded discussion of Aristotle's method, and new sections on key issues in perception, thought, akrasia, and mimesis. It concludes with an expanded assessment of Aristotle's legacy, sketching currently emerging Neo-Aristotelian movements in metaphysics and virtue ethics.},

  abstract = {In the de Broglie—Bohm pilot-wave interpretation of quantum mechanics (QM), the two degrees of freedom associated with a system are its wave function and configuration (i.e., point in configuration space). From a purely dynamical point of view, neither has priority over the other, and it is tempting to treat the interpretation as having a genuinely dualistic ontology — involving both ‘ψ-fields’ and corpuscles. (We shall use the term ‘corpuscle’ to designate the hypothetical de Broglie—Bohm point particle, the words ‘system’ and ‘particle’ meaning what they do in standard QM.) In so far as the pilot-wave interpretation provides a ‘causal’ picture, it is in terms of the action of the ψ-field on its associated corpuscle(s). How is this action to be understood? In his admirable 1993 survey of the pilot-wave interpretation, Holland writes that ... the manner in which the ψ-field couples to the particle [i.e., corpuscle] via a quantum force does not on the face of it involve any concepts of cause and effect beyond those of classical physics. It is not essentially different from the action of an electromagnetic field on a charged particle, or a gravitational field on a massive particle (although there is no obvious ‘quantum charge’ associated with the particle which responds to the quantum potential ...).

  abstract = {The author endeavours to show two things: first, that Schrödingers (and Eckarts) demonstration in March (September) 1926 of the equivalence of matrix mechanics, as created by Heisenberg, Born, Jordan and Dirac in 1925, and wave mechanics, as created by Schrödinger in 1926, is not foolproof; and second, that it could not have been foolproof, because at the time matrix mechanics and wave mechanics were neither mathematically nor empirically equivalent. That they were is the Equivalence Myth. In order to make the theories equivalent and to prove this, one has to leave the historical scene of 1926 and wait until 1932, when von Neumann finished his magisterial edifice. During the period 1926–1932 the original families of mathematical structures of matrix mechanics and of wave mechanics were stretched, parts were chopped off and novel structures were added. To Procrustean places we go, where we can demonstrate the mathematical, empirical and ontological equivalence of ‘the final versions of’ matrix mechanics and wave mechanics.

The present paper claims to be a comprehensive analysis of one of the pivotal papers in the history of quantum mechanics: Schrödingers equivalence paper. Since the analysis is performed from the perspective of Suppes structural view (‘semantic view’) of physical theories, the present paper can be regarded not only as a morsel of the internal history of quantum mechanics, but also as a morsel of applied philosophy of science. The paper is self-contained and presupposes only basic knowledge of quantum mechanics. For reasons of length, the paper is published in two parts; Part I appeared in the previous issue of this journal. Section 1 contains, besides an introduction, also the papers five claims and a preview of the arguments supporting these claims; so Part I, Section 1 may serve as a summary of the paper for those readers who are not interested in the detailed arguments.},

  volume = {12},
  abstract = {In the social sciences, two prevailing definitions of risk are: (1) risk is a situation or event where something of human value (including humans themselves) is at stake and where the outcome is uncertain; (2) risk is an uncertain consequence of an event or an activity with respect to something that humans value. According to these definitions, risk expresses an ontology (a theory of being) independent of our knowledge and perceptions. In this paper, we look closer into these two types of definitions. We conclude that the definitions provide a sound foundation for risk research and risk management, but compared to common terminology, they lead to conceptual difficulties that are incompatible with the everyday use of risk in most applications. By considering risk as a state of the world, we cannot conclude, for example, about the risk being high or low, or compare different options with respect to risk. A rephrasing of the two definitions is suggested: Risk refers to uncertainty about and severity of the consequences (or outcomes) of an activity with respect to something that humans value.},

  shorttitle = {From {{C}}-Numbers to {{Q}}-Numbers},
  abstract = {The history of quantum theory is a maze of conceptual problems. In this lucid and learned book, Olivier Darrigol tracks the role of formal analogies between classical and quantum theory, from Planck's first introduction of the quantum of action to Dirac's formulation of quantum mechanics. In so doing, Darrigol illuminates not only the history of quantum theory but also the role of analogies in scientific thinking and theory change. The most remarkable result of such analogical argument in quantum theory was Bohr's correspondence principle which, in Darrigol's words, "performed the acrobatic task of bridging two mutually contradictory theories (classical electrodynamics and atomic theory), without diminishing the contrast between them". By analyzing the origins, development, and applications of this principle, From c-Numbers to q-Numbers explains the remarkable fruitfulness of the research done under Bohr's guidance between 1916 and 1925 and shows why Heisenberg claimed that quantum mechanics was born as "a quantitative formulation of the correspondence principle". With a physicist's sure hand, Darrigol examines the formal and the epistemological aspects of the analogy between classical and quantum mechanics. Unlike previous works, which have tended to focus on qualitative, global arguments, he follows the lines of mathematical reasoning and symbolizing, and by doing so he is able to show the motivations of early quantum theorists more precisely - and provocatively - than ever before. For instance, Darrigol demonstrates that a universal principle of elementary chaos underlay Planck's analogies, and that Bohr's correspondence principle was related to his elaboration of a minimal-quantumtheoretical language. Most striking, Darrigol reveals how Dirac's personal conception of the relations among algebra, geometry, use of the analogy between c-numbers and and physics conditioned his highly creative q-numbers. Original, erudite, and witty, From c-Numbers to q-Numbers sets a new standard for the philosophically perceptive and mathematically precise history of quantum mechanics. For years to come it will influence historical and philosophical discussions of twentieth-century physics.},

The Everett interpretation is often criticised along these lines, and I shall argue that much of this criticism rests on a false dichotomy: that the macroworld must either be written directly into the formalism or be regarded as somehow illusory. By means of analogy with other areas of physics, I develop the view that the macroworld is instead to be understood in terms of certain structures and patterns which emerge from quantum theory (given appropriate dynamics, in particular decoherence). I extend this view to the observer, and in doing so make contact with functionalist theories of mind.},

This summary is, of course, somewhat oversimplified and quick at least in thesense that there are various notions of determinism and predictability at work in thephilosophical literature. In this essay I will focus on what I take to be the Laplacean visionfor determinism and predictability. While many forms of predictability areinconsistent with this vision, I argue that a suitably restricted notion of predictability,consistent with the practice of physicists, is implied by the Laplacean notion of determinism.It is argued that limitations on predictability are of an in principle nature in the Appendix.},

In addition to showing how recent metaphysics has drifted away from connection with all other serious scholarly inquiry as a result of not heeding this restriction, they demonstrate how to build a metaphysicscompatible with current fundamental physics ('ontic structural realism'), which, when combined with their metaphysics of the special sciences ('rainforest realism'), can be used to unify physics with the other sciences without reducing these sciences to physics itself. Taking science metaphysically seriously,Ladyman and Ross argue, means that metaphysicians must abandon the picture of the world as composed of self-subsistent individual objects, and the paradigm of causation as the collision of such objects.Everything Must Go also assesses the role of information theory and complex systems theory in attempts to explain the relationship between the special sciences and physics, treading a middle road between the grand synthesis of thermodynamics and information, and eliminativism about information. The consequences of the author's metaphysical theory for central issues in the philosophy of science are explored, including the implications for the realism vs. empiricism debate, the role ofcausation in scientific explanations, the nature of causation and laws, the status of abstract and virtual objects, and the objective reality of natural kinds.},

  abstract = {This concise book introduces nonphysicists to the core philosophical issues surrounding the nature and structure of space and time, and is also an ideal resource for physicists interested in the conceptual foundations of space-time theory. Tim Maudlin's broad historical overview examines Aristotelian and Newtonian accounts of space and time, and traces how Galileo's conceptions of relativity and space-time led to Einstein's special and general theories of relativity. Maudlin explains special relativity with enough detail to solve concrete physical problems while presenting general relativity in more qualitative terms. Additional topics include the Twins Paradox, the physical aspects of the Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction, the constancy of the speed of light, time travel, the direction of time, and more.  Introduces nonphysicists to the philosophical foundations of space-time theory  Provides a broad historical overview, from Aristotle to Einstein  Explains special relativity geometrically, emphasizing the intrinsic structure of space-time  Covers the Twins Paradox, Galilean relativity, time travel, and more  Requires only basic algebra and no formal knowledge of physics},

In this entry, we introduce and summarize the distinctivefeatures of this framework, and we discuss how it addresses a range ofclassic issues in the philosophy of science, including explanation,metaphysics, the relations between scientific disciplines, and theprocess of scientific discovery. For each of these issues, we show howthe mechanistic framework has reoriented philosophical work, what thenew mechanism has contributed to the discussion, and what remains tobe done.},

The main argument against scientific realism is that there have been enormously successful theories which were once accepted but are now regarded as false. The central question addressed in this paper is whether there is some reasonable way to have the best of both worlds: to give the argument from scientific revolutions its full weight and yet still adopt some sort of realist attitude towards presently accepted theories in physics and elsewhere. I argue that there is such a way - through structural realism, a position adopted by Poincare, and here elaborated and defended.},

  abstract = {A nonexistent object is something that does not exist. Some examplesoften cited are: Zeus, Pegasus, Sherlock Holmes, Vulcan, the perpetualmotion machine, the golden mountain, the fountain of youth, the roundsquare, etc.  Some important philosophers have thought that the veryconcept of a nonexistent object is contradictory (Hume) or logicallyill-formed (Kant, Frege), while others (Leibniz, Meinong, the Russellof Principles of Mathematics) have embraced itwholeheartedly., One of the reasons why there are doubts about the concept of anonexistent object is this: to be able to truly claim of an object thatit doesn't exist, it seems that one has to presuppose that it exists,for doesn't a thing have to exist if we are to make a true claim aboutit? In the face of this puzzling situation, one has to be very carefulwhen accepting or formulating the idea that there are nonexistentobjects. It turns out that Kant's view that “exists” is nota “real” predicate and Frege's view, that“exists” is not a predicate of individuals (i.e., apredicate that yields a well-formed sentence if one puts a singularterm in front of it), has to be abandoned if one is to accept the claimthat there are nonexistent objects., This entry is an examination of the many questions which arise inconnection with the view that there are nonexistent objects. Thefollowing are particularly salient: What reasons are there (if any) forthinking that there are nonexistent objects? If there are nonexistentobjects, then what kind of objects are they? How can they becharacterized? Is it possible to provide a consistent theory ofnonexistent objects? What is the explanatory force of a consistenttheory of nonexistent objects (if such a thing is possible)?},

  abstract = {Einstein correctly described the equivalence of mass and energy as“the most important upshot of the special theory ofrelativity” (Einstein, 1919), for this result lies at the core ofmodern physics. According to Einstein's famous equationE~=~mc2, the energy Eof a physical system is numerically equal to the product of its massm and the speed of light c squared. It is customaryto refer to this result as “the equivalence of mass andenergy,” or simply “mass-energy equivalence,” becauseone can choose units in which c = 1, and hence E =m., The two main philosophical questions surrounding Einstein's equationconcern how we ought to understand the assertion that mass and energyare in some sense equivalent and how we ought to understandassertions concerning the convertibility of mass into energy (or viceversa)., In this entry, we first discuss the physicsE~=~mc2 and its application (Section 1). In Section 2, we identifysix distinct, though related, philosophical interpretations ofEinstein's equation. We then discuss, in Section 3,the history of derivations ofE~=~mc2 and its philosophicalimportance. Finally, in Section 4 we give a selectiveaccount of the empirical confirmation of Einstein's equation thatfocuses on Cockcroft and Walton's (1932) first confirmation ofmass-energy equivalence and a very recent, and very accurateconfirmation by Rainville et al. (2005).},

This topic remains at the centre of metaphysical enquiry. The contributors examine the nature of essences, how they differ from other components of substance, and how they are related to these other components. The central questions discussed here are: What does Aristotle mean by 'potentiality' and 'actuality'? How do these concepts explicate matter and form, and how are they related to the actuality of substance? What is the role of matter and form in accounting for the unity, identity, and individuation of substances? These questions are crucial to an understanding of the unity of composite substances and their identity over time. The aim of the volume is both exegetical and philosophical: to address central issues in Aristotle's Metaphysics, and to stimulate further investigation of the problems and controversies that arise from these.},
