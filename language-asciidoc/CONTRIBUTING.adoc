= Contributing

In the spirit of free software, _everyone_ is encouraged to help improve this project.

To contribute code, simply fork the project on GitHub, hack away and send a pull request with your proposed changes.
Feel free to use the https://github.com/asciidoctor/atom-language-asciidoc/issues[issue tracker] to provide feedback or suggestions in other ways.

== Development

Before diving into the code, we recommend reading the article http://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-write-a-syntax-highlighting-package-for-atom/[How to Write a Syntax Highlighting Package for Atom].
That article gives you the background information you need to get started with hacking on this package.

To learn more about how the grammar works and useful resources for development, see <<Grammar>>.

=== Retrieve the source code

The source code for this plugin is available from https://github.com/asciidoctor/atom-language-asciidoc.

=== Retrieve the dependencies

Use the following command to download dependencies (https://github.com/atom/season[Season], http://www.coffeelint.org/[CoffeeLint], ...):

[source, shell]
----
apm install
----

=== Prepare for business

== Quality assurance

When opening a pull request on GitHub, https://travis-ci.org/asciidoctor/atom-language-asciidoc[Travis CI] will run the Atom package specs and lint using CoffeeScript files.
Of course you can do so yourself, so you can ensure your code will pass the check in the pull-request.

=== CoffeeScript lint

This package uses http://www.coffeelint.org/[CoffeeLint] to ensure that the code is uniformly structured.
The linter definitions are defined in the link:coffeelint.json[coffeelint.json].

When developing in Atom, the https://atom.io/packages/linter-coffeelint[linter-coffeelint] package exposes the linting in your editor.
It does require CoffeeLint to be http://www.coffeelint.org/#install[installed].

CoffeeLint can also be triggered from the command line:

[source, shell]
----
coffeelint -f coffeelint.json grammars/asciidoc.cson spec/*-spec.coffee snippets/language-asciidoc.cson
----

=== Package specs

Tests are defined in link:spec/asciidoc-spec.coffee[asciidoc-spec.coffee], which provide snippets of text and test if the parsed result meet the expectations.
Ideally all grammar features are covered in the specs (100% test coverage), with both positive and negative tests.
Having these tests present will help future contributors make improvements without accidentally breaking other parts of the package.

There are multiple ways in which you can run the tests:

.Testing from the command line
[source, shell]
----
atom --test spec
----

.Testing via the Command Pallet in Atom
----
Window: Run Package Specs
----

.Testing using the build-package.sh script
[source, shell]
----
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atom/ci/master/build-package.sh > build-package.sh
sh build-package.sh
----

== Grammar

The grammar is defined in files contains in the directory `grammars/repositories`.

The file link:grammars/language-asciidoc.cson[grammars/language-asciidoc.cson] is a generated file, *you must don't chnage this file manually*.

=== Generate the grammar file

* Run Atom in Dev Mode with the following command:

[source, shell]
----
atom -d .
----

* Open the command dialog with press keys: `Ctrl+Shift-P`
* In the command dialog, find and choose the item named `Asciidoc Grammar: Compile grammar and reload`
** Tips: write only `AG` for a quick access to the item.
* The grammar file is re-generated automatically.

=== Language definition

The Atom language definitions originate from the language definitions used by TextMate.
The language definition is interpreted by the https://github.com/atom/first-mate[first-mate] JavaScript module.

A language definition supports both single-line matches using a _match_ regular expression (regexp), and sections matches based on a _begin_ and _end_ regexps.
The regexps are based on the https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma[Oniguruma] regexp engine (also used in Ruby), as described in <<Regexp handling>>.

* http://www.apeth.com/nonblog/stories/textmatebundle.html[Practical TextMate guide]
* http://manual.macromates.com/en/language_grammars.html[TextMate language grammars manual]

=== Regexp handling

Atom uses the https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma[Oniguruma] library for parsing regular expressions via the https://github.com/atom/node-oniguruma[node-oniguruma] JavaScript module.
The http://oniguruma.rubyforge.org/oniguruma/files/Syntax_txt.html[Oniguruma documentation] provides an overview of all supported elements.

IMPORTANT: Patterns are defined as JavaScript strings.
That means backslashes must be escaped twice (`\\\\`), backslashes in character classes escaped once (`\\s`), and single quotes escaped once (`\'`).

Generally it can be said that POSIX-style regex elements are preferred (e.g., `+\p{Blank}+` and `+\p{Word}+`) as they better support internationalization.

=== Code language support

AsciiDoc offers the ability to include source code blocks, in a variety of languages.
By including the language definitions of the language set for the code block, AsciiDoc is able to offer code block language highlighting.
To get the most of out of this feature, development will have to keep up with languages available in Atom.
You can check the available source languages available in your Atom editor, to see if some language support is missing.

.Check source language support
. Open the _Developer Tools_: `Ctrl+Shift+I` on Linux and Windows, `Cmd+Alt+i` on Mac OS X.
. Run the query `Object.keys(atom.grammars.grammarsByScopeName).sort().join('\n')` in the _Console_.
