The TODO comment task board
----
**Turn your TODO comments into a task-board and let [imdone.io](https://imdone.io) do your issue tracking so you can stay in the zone.**  
Just use `alt+t` while editing a file to see your projects board.

You live in the code, your tasks should too!
----
Developers are creative people and the text editor is their canvas.  For decades they've used TODO style code comments to track issues that almost never end up in issue tracking software.  imdone is a plugin for your favorite text editor that turns code comments into trackable issues that you can update from your code.  It collects all TODO style comments in your project and organizes them in a drag and drop task-board that integrates with any web based issue tracking system.

imdone works best with todo.txt and markdown syntax.  See the [syntax guide at imdone-core](https://github.com/imdone/imdone-core#task-formats) for details.

Ignoring files
----
- Configuration setting  
You can ignore files with the "Exclude Vcs Ignored Paths" setting

- .imdoneignore  
`.imdoneignore` is implemented using the [ignore](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ignore) package.  Each file in your projects path is tested against the rules in `.imdoneignore`.  
To ignore all but some subdirectories, see this Stack Overflow question. [git - .gitignore exclude folder but include specific subfolder - Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5533050/gitignore-exclude-folder-but-include-specific-subfolder)

- .imdone/config.json  
imdone will also ignore files and folders that match a regex in the `.imdone/config.json`, `exclude` array.  The array is seeded with some common excludes on first run.

**IMPORTANT:** If your project is large (#files > 1000) consider adding an .imdoneignore file.

How To Link Code And Github Issues
----
Using [todo.txt metadata](https://github.com/imdone/imdone-core#metadata) in your tasks and a minor change to `.imdone/config.json`, you can link to external resources like github issues and profiles.  

- Add a `meta` attribute to `.imdone/config.json`  
```javascript
"meta": {
  "issue": {
    "urlTemplate": "https://github.com/imdone/imdone-core/issues/%s",
    "titleTemplate": "github issue #%s"
  }
}
```

- Use `issue:[gh issue id]` as metadata in your tasks.  
<pre>
// &#35;BACKLOG:0 issue:27 Export TODOs
</pre>

- Your issue is linked to the comment!  
![gh-issue-imdone](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/233505/9595122/72542350-502a-11e5-87b3-a4eb49428b7c.png)
