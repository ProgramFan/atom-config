# CMake build system for Atom

Uses the [atom-build](https://github.com/noseglid/atom-build) package to execute [CMake](https://CMake.org/)

* Currently the only supported build directory is a folder next to your project with the same name with '-build' (can be configured in settings) attached to it.
 * for example if your project source root what at ~/Desktop/project then the build directory would be ~/Desktop/project-build

* CMake configuration uses the default CMake generator for the current platform so it will use Visual Studio
on windows and GNU Make on linux. The CMake flag -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON is passed on cmake configuration for packages like [you-complete-me](https://atom.io/packages/you-complete-me) to take advantage of.

* Thanks to [assumptionsoup](https://github.com/assumptionsoup) the generator target and build suffix can be changed in the settings page of the package.

* If other CMake flags need to be used you will have to run CMake manually for the first time in the build directory mentioned before.
 * After configuration if you had already opened the source folder in atom you will have to run 'Build:refresh targets' before the project can be built.

This package requires [atom-build](https://github.com/noseglid/atom-build) to be installed.

** Note [atom-build-make](https://github.com/AtomBuild/atom-build-make) and [atom-build-gradle](https://github.com/AtomBuild/atom-build-gradle) where used as a reference for this project as I have almost no experience with web technologies and because of that fixes and additions are VERY welcome.
